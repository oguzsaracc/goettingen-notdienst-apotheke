## üë§ About The Developer

**Developer:** **Oguz Sarac**

I am currently pursuing a **Master's degree in Applied Computer Science at the University of G√∂ttingen**, focusing on bridging advanced software engineering concepts with practical community needs.

This project showcases my commitment to building robust, type-safe, and high-performance applications using **Software Development Principles**. It is a direct application of my academic background to solve a critical, local issue.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack (Technical Details)

This project is built using a modern, performance-focused stack:

* **Frontend Framework:** **React** with **Vite** (for fast development and bundling).
* **Language:** **TypeScript** (utilizing its robust type checking for enhanced reliability).
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** (for utility-first, highly responsive UI development).
* **Mapping:** **Leaflet.js** and **React-Leaflet** (for high-performance map integration).
* **Deployment:** **Vercel** (for continuous integration and blazing-fast hosting).

### Data Source Note

The MVP currently uses a **static JSON file** (`pharmacies.json`) containing daily duty data. This approach was chosen to validate the user experience first. The system is architected for a seamless transition to a dynamic API.

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Vision

The next essential step is automating the data pipeline to ensure 24/7 accuracy. This involves:

1.  **Automated Data Processing:** Implementing a dedicated **backend service** to automatically download, parse (XML), and filter the official daily duty data from the *Apotheken-Notdienstdaten* API.
2.  **Location Services:** Adding a feature to find the *nearest* on-duty pharmacy based on the user's current GPS location, further enhancing the application's utility for elderly users.
3. **Multilingual Support (i18n):** Implementing full language support for **Deutsch (German)** and **English**, recognizing the diverse community of G√∂ttingen (e.g., local residents, students, and visitors).
